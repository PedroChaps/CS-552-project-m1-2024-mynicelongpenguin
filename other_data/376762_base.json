In the considered problem, we are given a set $M$ of $m$ machines and a set $J$ of $n$ jobs. Each job $j\\in J$ has a processing time $p_j > 0$ and can be processed on a subset $N(j) \\subseteq M$ of the machines.  The goal is to assign each job $j$ to a machine in $N(j)$ so as to complete all the jobs by a given deadline $T$. (Each machine can only process one job at a time.) If we, for $j\\in J$ and $i\\in N(j)$, let $x_{ij}$ denote the indicator variable indicating that $j$ was assigned to $i$, then we can formulate the scheduling problem as the following integer linear program: \\begin{align*} \\sum_{i\\in N(j)} x_{ij} & = 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for all }  j\\in J & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Each job $j$ should be assigned to a machine $i\\in N(j)$)}} \\\\ \\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} x_{ij} p_j & \\leq T \\qquad \\mbox{for all } i \\in M & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Time needed to process jobs assigned to $i$ should be $\\leq T$)}} \\\\ x_{ij} &\\in \\{0,1\\}   \\  \\mbox{for all } j\\in J, \\ i \\in N(j) \\end{align*} The above integer linear program  is NP-hard to solve, but we can obtain a linear programming relaxation by relaxing the constraints $x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to $x_{ij} \\in [0,1]$. The obtained linear program can be solved in polynomial time using e.g. the ellipsoid method. \\\\[2mm] \\emph{Example.} An example is as follows. We have two machines $M = \\{m_1, m_2\\}$ and three jobs $J= \\{j_1, j_2, j_3\\}$. Job $j_1$ has processing time $1\/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_1$;  job $j_2$ has processing time $1\/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_2$; and job $j_3$ has processing time $1$ and can be assigned to either machine. Finally, we have the ``deadline'' $T=1$. An extreme point solution to the linear programming relaxation is $x^*_{11} = 1, x^*_{22} =1, x^*_{13} = 1\/2$ and $x^*_{23} = 1\/2$.
