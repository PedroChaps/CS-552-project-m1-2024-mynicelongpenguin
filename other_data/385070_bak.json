It guarantees two properties: completeness (eventually every process that crashes is detected) and accuracy (no correct process is suspected).\n\nNow, can we implement TRB with an eventually perfect failure detector under the assumption that at least one process can crash? The answer is no.\n\nTo implement TRB, we need a perfect failure detector that provides accurate information about process failures. However, even with an eventually perfect failure detector, there is no guarantee that the information about process failures will be accurate at all times. This is because the eventually perfect failure detector only guarantees accuracy eventually, not immediately.\n\nIn the presence of at least one process crash, the failure detector may not be able to accurately detect the failure immediately, leading to inconsistencies in the TRB implementation.

Gravitational force:\nThe gravitational force acting on the material point can be decomposed into two components: one perpendicular to the incline (normal force) and the other parallel to the incline (gravitational force along the incline).\nThe normal force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the incline, which can be calculated as $mg \\cos(\\alpha)$, where $m$ is the mass of the point and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\nTherefore, the normal force is also $mg \\cos(\\alpha)$.\nThe gravitational force along the incline is $mg \\sin(\\alpha)$.\n\n2. Spring force:\nThe spring force is given by Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement of the spring from its natural length.\nThe displacement of the spring from its natural length can be calculated as $l - l_0$, where $l$ is the current length of the spring.\nTherefore, the spring force is $-k(l - l_0)$, where the negative sign indicates that the force is directed opposite to the displacement.\n\nIn summary, the explicit expressions for the forces acting on the material point are:\n- Gravitational force perpendicular to the incline (normal force): $mg \\cos(\\alpha)$\n- Gravitational force along the incline: $mg \\sin(\\alpha)$\n- Spring force: $-k(l - l_0)$", "ranking_criteria": {"overall": "B", "correctness": "AB", "relevance": "AB", "clarity": "B", "completeness": "B", "other": "None"}}, {"course_id": 15006, "question_id": 4203, "question": "An expression is referentially transparent if it always returns the same value, no matter\nthe global state of the program.

Collaborative filtering involves making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). \n\nOne common method is to use item-based collaborative filtering, where the system recommends items that are similar to those that the user has liked in the past. In the case of a new user with no ratings, the system can recommend popular or highly-rated items that have been enjoyed by other users with similar tastes.\n\nAnother approach is to utilize content-based filtering, where the system recommends items based on the characteristics of the items and a profile of the user's preferences. This can be particularly useful for new users as it doesn't rely on past ratings but rather on the features of the items themselves.\n\nOverall, without any ratings from a new user, it is important to leverage collaborative or content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on similarities with other users or item characteristics.", "B": "To address the problem of recommending movies to a new user without any ratings, one common approach is to utilize collaborative filtering techniques.

This method involves analyzing the content of the movies (genres, actors, directors, etc.) and recommending movies that are similar in content to those that the user has enjoyed in the past.\n\nBy combining these different recommendation techniques and possibly incorporating additional features such as popularity or diversity of recommendations, we can effectively recommend movies to a new user without any ratings.", "ranking_criteria": {"overall": "B", "correctness": "AB", "relevance": "AB", "clarity": "B", "completeness": "B", "other": "None"}}, {"course_id": 15003, "question_id": 7368, "question": "What happens in the reliable broadcast algorithm if the completeness property of the failure detector is violated?", "A_chat_id": 55931, "B_chat_id": 55932, "A": "If the completeness property of the failure detector is violated, it means that the failure detector may not detect all process failures.

This aligns with the principle of least privilege as it restricts code execution to designated code pages, reducing the attack surface.\n\nB: Control Flow Integrity (CFI) protection on the forward edge checks and limits the reachable targets of control flow transfers. By restricting the possible paths of execution, CFI helps enforce the principle of least privilege by controlling the flow of code execution.\n\nC: Applying updates regularly is a good security practice to patch vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.
