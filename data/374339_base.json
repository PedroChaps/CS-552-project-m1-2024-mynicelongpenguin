We first, in subproblem~\\textbf{(a)}, give a new rounding for the classic vertex cover problem  and then give the algorithm for the more general problem in subproblem~\\textbf{(b)}. Recall that a vertex cover instance is specified by  an undirected graph $G= (V,E)$ and non-negative vertex-weights $w: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_+$. The task is to find a vertex cover $S \\subseteq V$ of minimum total weight $\\sum_{i\\in S} w(i)$, where a subset $S \\subseteq V$ of the vertices is said to be a vertex cover if for every edge $\\{i,j\\} \\in E$, $i\\in S$ or $j\\in S$. The natural LP relaxation  (as seen in class) is as follows: \\begin{align*} \\textbf{minimize} \\hspace{0.4cm} & \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i \\\\ \\textbf{subject to}\\hspace{0.4cm} &  x_i + x_j \\geq 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for $\\{i,j\\} \\in E$}\\\\ & \\hspace{0.9cm}  x_i  \\geq 0 \\qquad \\mbox{for $i\\in V$} \\end{align*} Given a fractional solution $x$ to the above linear program, a natural approach to solve the vertex cover problem is to give a rounding algorithm. Indeed, in class we  analyzed a simple rounding scheme: output the vertex cover  $S = \\{i\\in V: x_i \\geq 1\/2\\}$.  We proved that $w(S) \\leq 2 \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i$. In this subproblem, your task is to prove that the following alternative randomized rounding scheme give the same guarantee in expectation. The randomized rounding scheme is as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item Select $t \\in [0,1\/2]$ uniformly at  random. \\item Output $S_t = \\{i\\in V: x_i \\geq t\\}$. \\end{itemize} Prove (i) that the output $S_t$ is a feasible vertex cover solution (for any $t\\in [0,1\/2]$) and (ii) that $\\E[\\sum_{i\\in S_t} w(i)] \\leq 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i$ where the expectation is over the random choice of $t$.
